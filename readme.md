# Sax Lessons

### The Lowdown

This app helps organize my private saxophone lesson notes. I used to write them out by hand, but this proved unreliable because many students would lose them! Recently, I have been writing the notes out in a plain text file saved in a shared Google Drive folder. This app aims to make this process not only aesthetically pleasing, but expandable.
