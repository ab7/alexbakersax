# Sax Lessons Prototype

### The Lowdown

This app helps organize my private saxophone lesson notes. I used to write them out by hand, but this proved unreliable because many students would lose them! Recently, I have been writing the notes out in a plain text file saved in a shared Google Drive folder. This app aims to make this process not only aesthetically pleasing, but expandable.

### From Prototype to Tool

While this app is specifically for my teaching business, I hope to create a tool out of it! The goal is to make a music centered portal for teachers and students, where they can track notes and other useful materials. As I receive feed back, I will work on converting it into a scalable tool for teachers.

### Todo

* Dynamically cache content
* Same page login with js
* Implement better user validation
